### How to launch

1: Download or clone repository

$ bundle install
```

3: Create DataBase

$ bundle exec rails db:create
```

$ rails db:migrate
```

### How to use dotenv-rails for keeping AWS secret keys 

1: Use `gem 'dotenv-rails'` to store keys safely

2: Add `dotenv-rails` to the `:groups => [:development, :test]` and perform in the terminal `bundle install`

3: Using it is also not complicated: just set the environment variables in the file `.env` in the root of your project and specify the desired environment variables there:
```
#/my/rails/app/.env
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=bucket-name
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=EXAMPLEAWSACCESSKEYID
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=exampleawssecretaccesskey
export REGION=example_region
```
4: And now we can access our environment variables in the same way as in the previous example: `ENV ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']`, `ENV ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']`, `ENV ['S3_BUCKET_NAME']` and `ENV ['REGION']`. Naturally, do not forget to add our file `.env` in `.gitignore`, since the values in it are different for each developer.

### How to deploy on heroku

1: Signig up on Heroku
2: Install Heroku CLI.

3: Enter your Heroku credentials like email and password by using the command in terminal:
```
heroku login
```
4: Create application with unique name
```
heroku create app-name
```
5: Config heroku ENV keys, for each ENV keys that were added to the `.env` file do
```
heroku config:set S3_BUCKET_NAME=bucket-name
```
6: Declare ruby version in gemfile `ruby '2.x.x'` if it doesn't exist, then commit your changes.

7: From `master branch` push it on heroku
```
git push heroku master
 ```

8: Need provide DB migration for heroku

#### Problem solving with Devise.secret key error

1: Go to `application.rb` file and put line `config.secret_key_base = ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"]`
```ruby
module DevcampPortfolio
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.load_defaults 5.2

    config.secret_key_base = ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"]
  
    config.generators.system_tests = nil
  end
end
```

2: In terminal window type to get secret key
```
rails secret
```
and then copy and paste in the SECRET_KEY_BASE= after equal sign
```
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=here
```

3: Just in case, itâ€™s better to create `Procfile` in the root directory and add lines to it
```
web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
worker:  bundle exec rake jobs:work
```

4: Commit changes in master branch and push to your repository by following commands
```
git satus

git add .

git commit -m ' '

git push or git push origin master
```

5: Push on heroku
```
git push heroku master
```

#### Solving errors with Bundler version

1: Sometimes you need to delete `Gemfile.lock` and update gems on your machine `gem update`. If you need additional help use `bundle -h` in terminal.

2: Update bundle locally
```
bundle update
```

3: Commit your changes and push to heroku
```
git add Gemfile.lock

git commit -m 'Update Gemfile.lock for Heroku'

git push heroku master
```
