<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Learning to code has been an arduous task but well worth the time, sacrifice and growth. I hope to attain to much
  higher levels of understanding and ability as I continue to study and learn both for you and in my personal time.</p>
<p>I am always learning and am always on the lookout for new technologies that catch my interest, truly excited about the opportunities that lay ahead of me in
  this field and I cannot wait to see what I will build next as web developer.</p>
